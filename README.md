# Pong made in SFML
This is a non-traditional implementation of Pong written in SFML. Its a single player version featuring sound effects as well as added randomness to the ball, unfortunately I didn't add any relationship between the paddle speed and the ball speed as I didn't realize this feature existed in pong instead of this feature however the game is setup so the ball increases speed with every bounce. I once again made this to better learn and understand SFML and C++ but this time added an emphasis on threading. Overall very happy and pleased with how this turned out, and a build is included in the release section.
